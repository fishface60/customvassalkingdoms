Description
===========

Annoyed that custom Kingdoms stop happening when you become an Emperor?

Have a Kingdom that's too large to have a safe vassal King?

Is your capital in a large Kingdom that you'd prefer to hand off to a
Vassal King and you don't want them whining about you holding the capital?

If you answered yes to any of the above, then Custom Vassal Kingdoms
may be for you!

How do I make a custom vassal King?
-----------------------------------

Create a mega-duke who holds 3 de-jure duchies in a de-jure Kingdom,
then when you click the button for the decision they will be made a King.

GitHub Installation Instructions
================================

If you're installing from the Steam Workshop, you don't need to do this.

Either download the latest snapshot zip
(https://github.com/fishface60/customvassalkingdoms/archive/master.zip), and
extract the contents of the customvassalkingdoms-master folder into a directory
called highkings, or clone the repository and call it customvassalkingdoms.

Then copy the `customvassalkingdoms.mod` file out of the repository and put it into
your mod directory.

FAQs
====

1.  Does this mod conflict with any base game functionality or other mods?

    It should not. I was careful to use the drop-in files way of adding
    functionality, rather than editing existing files, so it should not
    override changes to base-game changes, which other mods may need
    to change.

    So if Paradox updates the game my mod won't force it to use old files,
    which may be incompatible with other changes.

    Similarly if another mod has to alter existing files, then my mod
    won't conflict with that, so theoretically, my mod should be usable
    in a total conversion.

2.  Can I use your mod in my mod?

    You can easily do this by just copying all the files from my mod
    into yours, as I've been careful not to override any existing files.

3.  May I use your mod in my mod?

    The mod is permissively licensed, so I couldn't stop you from doing
    so even if I wanted to.

    Giving me credit for the contribution would be nice, but you aren't
    required to.

4.  Why shouldn't I use your mod in my mod?

    You don't need to merge my mod into yours to have the functionality
    provided by my mod.

    You could instead list it as a recommended mod to install alongside.

    It becomes extra work for you to update your mod if you want to
    include a new version of my mod in yours, whereas if people subscribe
    to my mod then it's all automatic.

    You may accidentally break someone else's mod if both you and they
    include my mod.

    On a more personal note, it means that I don't get feedback on
    whether people like, or are actively using my mod, so if Paradox
    add a new feature to the game engine that would make my mod better,
    I may not think it's worth the effort to improve this mod.

5.  Given the above, why might I still want to include your mod in my mod?

    If it's a total conversion then it's less likely that there'll be
    other mods installed that would conflict, so you don't need to worry
    about that.

    Any changes to my mod will be focussing on improving the core features,
    but it's possible that your mod may conflict with a future version
    of my mod. So including a specific version of my mod would prevent
    updates to my mod causing problems.

    If you heavily depend on functionality provided by my mod, then
    including my mod would prevent your users from having broken
    installations if they forgot to include my mod.

    I'd prefer this were handled by creating a steam workshop collection
    of the kind "Items that work together", so you get a subscribe to
    all button to handle ensuring everything needed is instaled, but if
    it's a regular occurrence that your users fail to install dependent
    mods, then it may be the best approach.

Bugs
====

*   Using the High Kingdom mod to create a High Kingdom, when you've
    previously made a Custom King out of that territory makes Custom
    Kings independent when it destroys the Custom Kingdom.

TODO
====

*   Consider how best to balance the decisions.

    It should probably annoy Dukes in the Kingdom that is losing territory
    to new custom Kingdoms.

*   Consider how to make the new Kingdom viceroyal if the vassal was viceroyal.

    It's undocumented on ck2wiki.com, and there's no explicit announcement
    of how to do it in the ChangeLog, other than for history files.

    If there's no way to create the titles as Viceroyal, then I'll have to
    create the title in the scope of the Emperor and Viceroyally grant it.
